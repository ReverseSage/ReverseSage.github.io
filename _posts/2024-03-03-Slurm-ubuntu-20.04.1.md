Instructions for setting up a SLURM cluster using Ubuntu 20.04.1 with GPUs.  Go from a pile of hardware to a functional GPU cluster with job queueing and user management.

OS used: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS


# Overview
This guide will help you create and install a CPU/GPU HPC cluster with a job queue and user management.  The idea is to have a GPU cluster which allows use of a few GPUs by many people.  Using multiple GPUs at once is not the point here, and hasn't been tested.  This guide demonstrates how to create a GPU cluster for neural networks (deep learning) which uses Python and related neural network libraries (Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch), CUDA, and NVIDIA GPU cards.  You can expect this to take you a few days up to a week.

## Outline of steps:

- Prepare hardware
- Install OSs
- Cluster time synchronization 
- Sync UID/GIDs or create slurm/munge users
- Slurm installation (controller and slave daemon)
- Install Software (Nvidia drivers, Anaconda and Python packages)
- Install/configure file sharing (NFS here; if using more than one node/computer in the cluster)
- Install munge/SLURM and configure

## Acknowledgements
This wouldn't have been possible without this [github repo](https://github.com/mknoxnv/ubuntu-slurm) from mknoxnv.  I don't know who that person is, but they saved me weeks of work trying to figure out all the conf files and services, etc.

## Upcoming labels
- master      = this section will apply on master node only.
- node        = this section will apply on slave node only.
- master-node = this section will apply on both master and slave.

# Preparing Hardware

If you do not already have hardware, here are some considerations:

Top-of-the-line commodity motherboards can handle up to 4 GPUs.  You should pay attention to PCI Lanes in the motherboard and CPU specifications.  Usually GPUs can take up to 16 PCI Lanes, and work fastest for data transfer when using all 16 lanes.  To use 4 GPUs in one machine, your motherboard should support at least 64 PCI Lanes, and CPUs should have at least 64 Lanes available.  M.2 SSDs can use PCI lanes as well, so it can be better to have a little more than 64 Lanes if possible.  The motherboard and CPU specs usually detail the PCI lanes.

We used NVIDIA GPU cards in our cluster, but many AMD cards [should now work](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/) with Python deep learning libraries now.

Power supply wattage is also important to consider, as GPUs can take a lot of Watts at peak power.

You only need one computer, but to have more than 4 GPUs you will need at least 2 computers.  This guide assumes you are using more than one computer in your cluster.

# Installing operating systems

Once you have hardware up and running, you need to install an OS.  From my research I've found Ubuntu is the top Linux distribution as of 2019 (both for commodity hardware and servers), and is recommended.  Currently the latest long-term stability version is Ubuntu 18.04.3, which is what was used here.  LTS are usually better because they are more stable over time.  Other Linux distributions may differ in some of the commands.

I recommend creating a bootable USB stick and installing Ubuntu from that.  Often with NVIDIA, the installation freezes upon loading and [this fix](https://askubuntu.com/a/870245/458247) must be implemented.  Once the boot menu appears, choose Ubuntu or Install Ubuntu, then press 'e', then add `apci=off` directly after `quiet splash` (leaving a space between splish and apci).  Then press F10 and it should boot.

I recommend using [LVM](https://www.howtogeek.com/211937/how-to-use-lvm-on-ubuntu-for-easy-partition-resizing-and-snapshots/) when installing (there is a checkbox for it with Ubuntu installation), so that you can add and extend storage HDDs if needed.

**Note**: Along the way I used the package manager to update/upgade software many times (`sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`) followed by reboots.  If something is not working, this can be a first step to try to debug it.

## Cluster time synchronization
first you need to make sure to disable the firewall (ufw) that will save you a lot of headache.  

**(master-node)**  
```bash
sudo ufw disable
```  
Now we will sync time on our cluster nodes.  
you need `ntp` package
```bash
  sudo apt install ntp
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
  
```
 a GUI will open then choose `UTC` timezone.
 Next we need to add the following lines 
 ```bash
  server 127.127.1.0
  fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10
 ```
  to the file `/etc/ntp.conf` then restart the service to apply.
  ```bash
  sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart
  ```
**(node)**
## Synchronizing GID/UIDs
It's recommend to sync the GIDs and UIDs across machines.  This can be done with something like LDAP (install instructions [here](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-and-configure-openldap-ubuntu-18-04/) and [here](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-openldap-on-ubuntu-18-04/)).  In my experience, for basic cluster management where all users can read and write to the folders where job files exist, the only GIDs and UIDs that need to be synced are the slurm and munge users.  Other users can be created and run SLURM jobs without having usernames on the other machines in the cluster.

However, if you want to isolate access to users' home folders (best practice I'd say), then you must synchronize users across the cluster.  The easiest way I've found to synchronize UIDs and GIDs across an Ubuntu cluster is FreeIPA.  Here are installation instructions:

- [Server (master node)](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-and-configure-freeipa-server-on-ubuntu-18-04-ubuntu-16-04/) (note: I had to run [this command](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54539428/4549682) to fix an issue after installing)
- [Client (worker nodes)](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-configure-freeipa-client-on-ubuntu-18-04-ubuntu-16-04-centos-7/)

It is important that you set the hostname to a FQDN, otherwise kerberos/FreeIPA won't work.  If you accidentally set the hostname during the kerberos setup to the wrong thing, you can change it in `/etc/krb5.conf`.  You could also completely purge kerberos [like so](https://serverfault.com/a/885525/305991).  If you need to reconfigure the ipa configuration, you can do `sudo ipa-server-install --uninstall` then try installing again.  I had to do the uninstall twice for it to work.

## Synchronizing time
Free-IPA should take care of syncing time, so you shouldn't have to worry about this if you setup freeipa.  You can see if times are synced with the `date` command on the various machines.


It's not a bad idea to sync the time across the servers.  [Here's how](https://knowm.org/how-to-synchronize-time-across-a-linux-cluster/).  One time when I set it up, it was ok, but another time the slurmctld service wouldn't start and it was because the times weren't synced.


## Set up munge and slurm users and groups
Immediately after installing OS’s, you want to create the munge and slurm users and groups on all machines.  The GID and UID (group and user IDs) must match for munge and slurm across all machines.  If you have a lot of machines, you can use the parallel SSH utilities mentioned before.  There are also other options like NIS and NISplus.  One other option is to use FreeIPA to create users and groups.

On all machines we need the munge authentication service and slurm installed.  First, we want to have the munge and slurm users/groups with the same UIDs and GIDs.  In my experience, these are the only GID and UIDs that need synchronization for the cluster to work.  On all machines:

```bash
sudo adduser -u 1111 munge --disabled-password --gecos ""
sudo adduser -u 1121 slurm --disabled-password --gecos ""
```

#### You shouldn’t need to do this, but just in case, you could create the groups first, then create the users

```bash
sudo addgroup -gid 1111 munge
sudo addgroup -gid 1121 slurm
sudo adduser -u 1111 munge --disabled-password --gecos "" -gid 1111
sudo adduser -u 1121 slurm --disabled-password --gecos "" -gid 1121
```

When a user is created, a group with the same name is created as well.

The numbers don’t matter as long as they are available for the user and group IDs.  These numbers seemed to work with a default Ubuntu 18.04.3 installation.  It seems like by default ubuntu sets up a new user with a UID and  GID of UID + 1 if the GID already exists, so this follows that pattern.



## Installing software/drivers
Next you should install SSH.  Open a terminal and install: `sudo apt install openssh-server -y`.

Once you have SSH on the machines, you may want to use a [parallel SSH utility](https://www.tecmint.com/run-commands-on-multiple-linux-servers/) to execute commands on all machines at once.

### Install NVIDIA drivers
You will need the latest NVIDIA drivers install for their cards.  The procedure [currently is](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2019/04/nvidia-430-09-gtx-1650-support/):

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-430
```

The 430 driver will probably update soon.  You can use `sudo apt-cache search nvidia-driver*` to find the latest one, or go to the "Software & Updates" menu to install it.  For some reason, on the latest install I had to use aptitude to install it:

```bash
sudo apt-get install aptitude -y
sudo aptitude install nvidia-driver-430
```

But that still didn't seem to solve the issue, and I installed it via the "Software & Updates" menu under "Additional Drivers".

We also use [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/) for remote GUI access.

## Install the Anaconda Python distribution.
Anaconda makes installing deep learning libraries easier, and doesn’t require installing CUDA/CuDNN libraries (which is a pain).  Anaconda handles the CUDA and other dependencies for deep learning libraries.

Download the distribution file:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
You may want to visit https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/ to get the latest anaconda version instead, though you can use:


`conda update conda anaconda`

or

`conda update --all`

to update Anaconda once it’s installed.

Once the .sh file is downloaded, you should make it executable with

`sudo chmod +777 Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh`

then run the file:

`./Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh`

I chose yes for `Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3
by running conda init?`.

Then you should do `source ~/.bashrc` to enable `conda` as a command.

If you chose `no` for the `conda init` portion, you may need to add some aliases to bashrc:

`nano ~/.bashrc`

Add the lines:

```bash
alias conda=~/anaconda3/bin/conda
alias python=~/anaconda3/bin/python
alias ipython=~/anaconda3/bin/ipython
```

Now install some anaconda packages:

```bash
conda update conda
conda install anaconda
conda install python=3.6
conda install tensorflow-gpu keras pytorch
```

The 3.6 install can take a while to complete (environment solving with conda is slow; it took about 15 minutes for me even on a fast computer -- the environment solving is definitely a big drawback of anaconda).  Not a bad idea to use tmux and put the `conda install python=3.6` in a `tmux` shell in case an SSH session is interrupted.

Python3.6 is the latest version with easy support for tensorflow and some other packages.


At this point you can use this code to test GPU functionality with this [demo code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keras-team/keras/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py), you could also use [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38580201/4549682).


# Install NFS (shared storage)
In order for SLURM to work properly, there must be a storage location present on all computers in the cluster with the same files used for jobs.  All computers in the cluster must be able to read and write to this directory.  One way to do this is with NFS, although other options such as OCFS2 exist.  Here we use NFS.

For the instructions, we will call the primary server `master` (the one hosting storage and the SLURM controller) and assume we have one worker node (another computer with GPUs) called `worker`.  We will also assume the username/groupname for the main administrative account on all machines is `admin:admin`.  I used the same username and group for the administrative accounts on all the servers.

## Master node
On the master server, do:

`sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y`

Make a storage location:

`sudo mkdir /storage`

In my case, /storage was actually the mount point for a second HDD (LVM, which was expanded to 20TB).

Change ownership to your administrative username and group:

`sudo chown admin:admin /storage`

Next we need to add rules for the shared location.  This is done with:

`sudo nano /etc/exports`

Then adding the line:

`/storage    *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)`

The * is for IP addresses or hostnames.  In this case we allow anything, but you may want to limit it to your IPs/hostnames in the cluster.  In fact, it wasn't working for me unless I explicitly set the IPs of the clients here.  You have to have a separate entry for each IP.  Mine ended up looking like:

`/storage 172.xx.224.xx(rw,sync,no_root_squash,all_squash,anonuid=999999,anongid=999999) 172.xx.224.xx(rw,sync,no_root_squash,all_squash,anonuid=999999,anongid=999999)`

where the 'xx's are actual numbers.

Then start the NFS service:

`sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server.service`

It should start automatically upon restarts.

You should also add a rule to allow for NFS traffic from the workers through port 2049.  This is done like so:

`sudo ufw allow from <ip_addr> to any port nfs`

Check the status with `sudo ufw status`.  You should see a rule to allow traffic to port 2049 from your worker nodes' IP addresses. [Here's more info](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-ubuntu-16-04).


## Client nodes
Now we can set up the clients.  On all worker servers:

```bash
sudo apt install nfs-common -y
sudo mkdir /storage
sudo chown admin:admin /storage
sudo mount master:/storage /storage
```

To make the drive mount upon restarts for the worker nodes, add this to fstab (`sudo nano /etc/fstab`):

`master:/storage /storage nfs auto,timeo=14,intr 0 0`

This can be done like so:

`echo master:/storage /storage nfs auto,timeo=14,intr 0 0 | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab`

Now any files put into /storage from the master server can be seen on all worker servers connect via NFS.  The worker servers MUST be read and write.  If not, any sbatch jobs will give an exit status of 1:0.


# Preparing for SLURM installation
## Passwordless SSH from master to all workers

First we need passwordless SSH between the master and compute nodes.  We are still using `master` as the master node hostname and `worker` as the worker hostname.  On the master:

```bash
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id admin@worker
```

To do this with many worker nodes, you might want to set up a small script to loop through worker hostnames or IPs.

## Install munge on the master:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libmunge-dev libmunge2 munge -y
sudo systemctl enable munge
sudo systemctl start munge
```

Test munge if you like:
`munge -n | unmunge | grep STATUS`


Copy the munge key to /storage
```bash
sudo cp /etc/munge/munge.key /storage/
sudo chown munge /storage/munge.key
sudo chmod 400 /storage/munge.key
```

## Install munge on worker nodes:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libmunge-dev libmunge2 munge
sudo cp /storage/munge.key /etc/munge/munge.key
sudo systemctl enable munge
sudo systemctl start munge
```

If you want, you can test munge:
`munge -n | unmunge | grep STATUS`

## Prepare DB for SLURM

These instructions more or less follow this github repo: https://github.com/mknoxnv/ubuntu-slurm

First we want to clone the repo:
`cd /storage`
`git clone https://github.com/mknoxnv/ubuntu-slurm.git`

Install prereqs:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git gcc make ruby ruby-dev libpam0g-dev libmariadb-client-lgpl-dev libmysqlclient-dev mariadb-server build-essential libssl-dev -y
sudo gem install fpm
```

Next we set up MariaDB for storing SLURM data:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable mysql
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo mysql -u root
```

Within mysql:
```sql
create database slurm_acct_db;
create user 'slurm'@'localhost';
set password for 'slurm'@'localhost' = password('slurmdbpass');
grant usage on *.* to 'slurm'@'localhost';
grant all privileges on slurm_acct_db.* to 'slurm'@'localhost';
flush privileges;
exit
```

Copy the default db config file:
`cp /storage/ubuntu-slurm/slurmdbd.conf /storage`

Ideally you want to change the password to something different than `slurmdbpass`.  This must also be set in the config file `/storage/slurmdbd.conf`.

# Install SLURM
## Download and install SLURM on Master

### Build the SLURM .deb install file
It’s best to check the downloads page and use the latest version (right click link for download and use in the wget command).  Ideally we’d have a script to scrape the latest version and use that dynamically.

You can use the -j option to specify the number of CPU cores to use for 'make', like `make -j12`.  `htop` is a nice package that will show usage stats and quickly show how many cores you have.

```bash
cd /storage
wget https://download.schedmd.com/slurm/slurm-19.05.2.tar.bz2
tar xvjf slurm-19.05.2.tar.bz2
cd slurm-19.05.2
./configure --prefix=/tmp/slurm-build --sysconfdir=/etc/slurm --enable-pam --with-pam_dir=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/ --without-shared-libslurm
make
make contrib
make install
cd ..
```

### Install SLURM
```bash
sudo fpm -s dir -t deb -v 1.0 -n slurm-19.05.2 --prefix=/usr -C /tmp/slurm-build .
sudo dpkg -i slurm-19.05.2_1.0_amd64.deb
```

Make all the directories we need:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/slurm /etc/slurm/prolog.d /etc/slurm/epilog.d /var/spool/slurm/ctld /var/spool/slurm/d /var/log/slurm
sudo chown slurm /var/spool/slurm/ctld /var/spool/slurm/d /var/log/slurm
```

Copy slurm control and db services:
```bash
sudo cp /storage/ubuntu-slurm/slurmdbd.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp /storage/ubuntu-slurm/slurmctld.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

The slurmdbd.conf file should be copied before starting the slurm services:
`sudo cp /storage/slurmdbd.conf /etc/slurm/`

Start the slurm services:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable slurmdbd
sudo systemctl start slurmdbd
sudo systemctl enable slurmctld
sudo systemctl start slurmctld
```

If the master is also going to be a worker/compute node, you should do:

```bash
sudo cp /storage/ubuntu-slurm/slurmd.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable slurmd
sudo systemctl start slurmd
```

## Worker nodes
Now install SLURM on worker nodes:

```bash
cd /storage
sudo dpkg -i slurm-19.05.2_1.0_amd64.deb
sudo cp /storage/ubuntu-slurm/slurmd.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable slurmd
sudo systemctl start slurmd
```

## Configuring SLURM

Next we need to set up the configuration file.  Copy the default config from the github repo:

`cp /storage/ubuntu-slurm/slurm.conf /storage/slurm.conf`

Note: for job limits for users, you should add the [AccountingStorageEnforce=limits](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resource_limits.html) line to the config file.

Once SLURM is installed on all nodes, we can use the command

`sudo slurmd -C`

to print out the machine specs.  Then we can copy this line into the config file and modify it slightly.  To modify it, we need to add the number of GPUs we have in the system (and remove the last part which show UpTime).  Here is an example of a config line:

`NodeName=worker1 Gres=gpu:2 CPUs=12 Boards=1 SocketsPerBoard=1 CoresPerSocket=6 ThreadsPerCore=2 RealMemory=128846`

Take this line and put it at the bottom of `slurm.conf`.

Next, setup the `gres.conf` file.  Lines in `gres.conf` should look like:

```bash
NodeName=master Name=gpu File=/dev/nvidia0
NodeName=master Name=gpu File=/dev/nvidia1
```

If you have multiple GPUs, keep adding lines for each node and increment the last number after nvidia.

Gres has more options detailed in the docs: https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html (near the bottom).

Finally, we need to copy .conf files on **all** machines.  This includes the `slurm.conf` file, `gres.conf`, `cgroup.conf` , and `cgroup_allowed_devices_file.conf`.  Without these files it seems like things don’t work.

```bash
sudo cp /storage/ubuntu-slurm/cgroup* /etc/slurm/
sudo cp /storage/slurm.conf /etc/slurm/
sudo cp /storage/gres.conf /etc/slurm/
```

This directory should also be created on workers:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/spool/slurm/d
sudo chown slurm /var/spool/slurm/d
```

After the conf files have been copied to all workers and the master node, you may want to reboot the computers, or at least restart the slurm services:

Workers:
`sudo systemctl restart slurmd`
Master:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart slurmctld
sudo systemctl restart slurmdbd
sudo systemctl restart slurmd
```

Next we just create a cluster:
`sudo sacctmgr add cluster compute-cluster`


## Configure cgroups

I think cgroups allows memory limitations from SLURM jobs and users to be implemented.  Set memory cgroups on all workers with:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
And change the following variable to:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1"
sudo update-grub
```
Finally at the end, I did one last `sudo apt update`, `sudo apt upgrade`, and `sudo apt autoremove`, then rebooted the computers:
`sudo reboot`


# User Management
## Adding users

Adding users can be done with Linux tools and SLURM commands.  It’s best to create a group for different user groups:

`sudo groupadd normal`

[Here is an example script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReverseSage/Slurm-ubuntu-20.04.1/master/create_users.sh) to add users from a csv file.  There is also a [script for deleting users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReverseSage/Slurm-ubuntu-20.04.1/master/delete_users.sh).

We are adding users within the FreeIPA system, within the SLURM system, and creating a home directory.  The user is set to expire a little over a year from creation, and the password is set to expire upon the first login (prompting the user to change their password).


## Storage quotas
Next we need to set storage quotas for the user.  Follow [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-filesystem-quotas-on-ubuntu-18-04) to set up the quota settings on the machine.

Then we can set quotas:

```bash
sudo setquota -u ngeorge 150G 150G 0 0 /storage
sudo setquota -u ngeorge 5G 5G 0 0 /
```

The `/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root` is the LVM partition for the root drive `/`, and `/dev/disk/by-uuid/987d372b-9c96-4e62-af82-2d95dc6655b4` is the <file system> from `/etc/fstab` for the HDD /storage.

This sets the soft and hard limits to 150GB for /storage.


To see how much of the quota people are using:
```bash
sudo repquota -s /
sudo repquota -s /storage
```

The new users don’t seem to always show up until they have saved something on the drive.  You can also specifically look at one user with:

`sudo quota -vs ngeorge`


## Deleting SLURM users on expiration
The slurm account manager has no way to set an expiration for users.  So we use [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReverseSage/Slurm-ubuntu-20.04.1/master/check_if_user_expired.sh) to check if the Linux username has expired, and if so, we delete the slurm username and home directory.  This runs on a cronjob once per day.  At it to the crontab file with:

`sudo crontab -e`

Add this line to run at 5 am every day on the machine:

`0 5 * * * bash /home/<username>/slurm_gpu_ubuntu/check_if_user_expired.sh
`
Obviously fix the path to where the script is, and change the username to yours.

# Troubleshooting

## Log files
When in doubt, you can check the log files.  The locations are set in the slurm.conf file, and are `/var/log/slurmd.log` and `/var/log/slurmctld.log` by default.  Open them with `sudo nano /var/log/slurmctld.log`.  To go to the bottom of the file, use ctrl+_ and ctrl+v.  I also changed the log paths to `/var/log/slurm/slurmd.log` and so on, and changed the permissions of the folder to be owner by slurm: `sudo chown slurm:slurm /var/log/slurm`.

## Checking SLURM states
Some helpful commands:

`scontrol ping` -- this checks if the controller node can be reached.  If this isn't working (i.e. the command returns 'DOWN' and not 'UP'), you might need to allow connections to the slurmctrlport (in the slurm.conf file).  This is set to 6817 in the config file.  To allow connections with the firewall, execute:

`sudo ufw allow from any to any port 6817`

and

`sudo ufw reload`

## Error codes 1:0 and 2:0
If trying to run a job with `sbatch` and the exit code is 1:0, this is usually a file writing error.  The first thing to check is that your output and error file paths in the .job file are correct.  Also check the .py file you want to run has the correct filepath in your .job file.  Then you should go to the logs (`/var/log/slurm/slurmctld.log`) and see which node the job was trying to run on.  Then go to that node and open the logs (`/var/log/slurm/slurmd.log`) to see what it says.  It may say something about the path for the output/error files, or the path to the .py file is incorrect.

It could also mean your common storage location is not r/w accessible to all nodes.  In the logs, this would show up as something about permissions and unable to write to the filesystem.  Double-check that you can create files on the /storage location on all workers with something like `touch testing.txt`.  If you can't create a file from the worker nodes, you probably have some sort of NFS issue.  Go back to the NFS section and make sure everything looks ok.  You should be able to create directories/files in /storage from any node with the admin account and they should show up as owned by the admin user.  If not, you may have some issue in your /etc/exports or with your GID/UIDs not matching.

If the exit code is 2:0, this can mean there is some problem with either the location of the python executable, or some other error when running the python script.  Double check that the srun or python script is working as expected with the python executable specified in the sbatch job file.

If some workers are 'draining', down, or unavailable, you might try:

`sudo scontrol update NodeName=worker1 State=RESUME`


## Node is stuck draining (drng from `sinfo`)
This has happened due to the memory size in slurm.conf being higher than actual memor size.  Double check the memory from `free -m` or `sudo slurmd -C` and update slurm.conf on all machines in the cluster.  Then run `sudo scontrol update NodeName=worker1 State=RESUME`

## Nodes are not visible upon restart
After restarting the master node, sometimes the workers aren't there. I've found I often have to do `sudo scontrol update NodeName=worker1 State=RESUME` to get them working/available.


## Taking a node offline
The best way to take a node offline for maintenance is to drain it:
`sudo scontrol update NodeName=worker1 State=DRAIN Reason='Maintenance'`

Users can see the reason with `sinfo -R`


## Testing GPU load
Using `watch -n 0.1 nvidia-smi` will show the GPU load in real-time.  You can use this to monitor jobs as they are scheduled to make sure all the GPUs are being utilized.




## Setting account options
You may want to limit jobs or submissions.  Here is how to set attributes (-1 means no limit):
```bash
sudo sacctmgr modify account students set GrpJobs=-1
sudo sacctmgr modify account students set GrpSubmitJobs=-1
sudo sacctmgr modify account students set MaxJobs=-1
sudo sacctmgr modify account students set MaxSubmitJobs=-1
```

## FreeIPA Troubleshooting

If you can't access the FreeIPA admin web GUI, you may try changing permissions on the Kerberos folder as noted [here](https://scattered.network/2019/04/09/freeipa-webui-login-fails-with-login-failed-due-to-an-unknown-reason/).

To get the machines to talk to each other with FreeIPA, you may also need to take some or all of these steps:

- [Install a DNS service on the IPA server](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/FreeIPA_Guide/enabling-dns.html)
- [configure it to recognize the clients](https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-install-freeipa-client-on-ubuntu-server-1804/#step-testing-freeipa-client)
- This may also require enabling TCP and UDP traffic on port 53, and changing
the [resolv.conf file on the clients](http://clusterfrak.com/sysops/app_installs/freeipa_clients/) to recognize the new name server on the server computer
- change the /etc/nsswitch.conf file to include the line "initgroups: files sss", and
add several instances "sss" to [other lines in this file](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1366569)


# Better sacct

`sacct --format=jobid,jobname,state,exitcode,user,account`

More on sacct [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html).


# Changing IPs
If the IP addresses of your machines change, you will need to update these in the file `/etc/hosts` on all machines and `/etc/exports` on the master node.  It's best to restart after making these changes.

# NFS directory not showing up
Check the service is running on the master node:
`sudo systemctl status nfs-kernel-server.service`

If it is not working, you may have a syntax error in your /etc/exports file.  Rebooting after getting this working is a good idea.  Not a bad idea to reboot the client computers as well.

Once you have the service running on the master node, then see if you can manually mount the drive on the clients:

`sudo mount master:/storage /storage`

If it is hanging here, try mounting on the master server:

`sudo mkdir /test`
`sudo mount master:/storage /test`

If this works, you might have an issue with ports being blocked or other connection issues between the master and clients.

You should check your firewall status with `sudo ufw status`.  You should see a rule allowing port 2049 access from your worker nodes.  If you don't have it, be sure to add it with `sudo ufw allow from <ip_addr> to any port nfs` then `sudo ufw reload`.  You should use the IP and not the hostname.  A reference for this is [here]().


# Node not able to connect to slurmctld
If a node isn't able to connnect to the controller (server/master), first check that time is properly synced.  Try using the `date` command to see if the times are synced across the servers.

# Unable to uninstall and reinstall freeipa client
If you are trying to uninstall the freeipa client and reinstall it and it fails (e.g. gives an error `The ipa-client-install command failed. See /var/log/ipaclient-install.log for more information`), you can try installing it with:

```
sudo ipa-client-install --hostname=`hostname -f` \
--mkhomedir --server=copper.regis.edu \
--domain regis.edu --realm REGIS.EDU --force-join
```

where the domain is your FQDN instead of regis.edu and instead of 'copper' you should use your server's name.

You might also try removing this file instead:

`sudo rm /var/lib/ipa-client/sysrestore/sysrestore.state`

However, when I was having this problem, it appeared to be some issue with the LDAP and SSSD not working.  I ended up reformatting and reinstalling the OS on the problem machine instead of trying to debug SSSD which looked extremely time consuming.


# Running a demo file

To test the cluster, it's useful to run some demo code.  Since Keras is within TensorFlow from version 2.0 onward, there are two demo files under the folder 'demo_files'.  tf1_test.py is for TensorFlow 1.x, and tf2_test.py is for TensorFlow 2.x.

To run the demo file, it's best to first just run it with the system Python to see if it works.  You can run `python tf2_test.py`, and if it works then you can proceed to the next step.  If not, check the Python path (`which python`) to make sure it's using the correct Python executable.

To ensure you're using the GPU and not CPU, you can run `nvidia-smi` to watch and make sure the GPU memory is getting used while running the file.  `watch -n 0.1 nvidia-smi` will show the GPU memory updated every 0.1 second.

Once the TensorFlow demo file works, you can try submitting it as a SLURM job.  This uses the test.job file.  Run `sbatch test.job`.  Then you can check the status of the job with `sacct`.  This should show 'running', and you should see GPU being used on one of the worker nodes.  To specify the exact worker node being used, add a line to the .job file:
`#SBATCH --nodelist=worker_name`
where 'worker_name' is the name of the node.
You should also be able to use `sinfo` to check which nodes are running jobs.
